# AWS Data Pipeline End-to-End Showcase

This repository demonstrates the complete development and deployment lifecycle of a scalable data pipeline on AWS. It leverages CloudFormation for infrastructure provisioning and includes resources to guide you through setup, configuration, and optimization.

## Features

* **CloudFormation Template:** Quickly deploy your data pipeline's AWS infrastructure (S3 buckets, IAM roles, Lambda functions, etc.).
* **Code:** Python scripts for data transformation, enrichment, and loading.
* **Documentation:** Clear instructions on how to customize and extend the pipeline.
* **Best Practices:** Guidelines for error handling, logging, security, and performance tuning.
* **Example Data:** Sample dataset for testing and development.

## Pipeline Architecture

[Provide a visual diagram here - It could be a simple flow diagram or a more detailed architecture diagram using tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or similar.]

1. **Data Ingestion:** Data is uploaded to an S3 bucket.
2. **Data Processing:**
   * **Lambda Function:** Triggered by S3 events, performs data validation, transformation, and enrichment.
   * **Glue ETL Job (Optional):** For more complex transformations or when dealing with large datasets, you can use AWS Glue.
3. **Data Storage:** Processed data is stored in a target S3 bucket or loaded into a database like Amazon Redshift or DynamoDB.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts:** CloudWatch alarms and metrics are set up to track pipeline health.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   * AWS Account with appropriate permissions.
   * Python installed locally.
   * [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured.
   * Familiarize yourself with CloudFormation, S3, Lambda, and the other AWS services used in the pipeline.

2. **Deployment**
   * **CloudFormation:** Use the provided template (`cloudformation.yaml`) to deploy the AWS infrastructure.  Modify parameters as needed.
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-data-pipeline --template-body file://cloudformation.yaml
   ```
   * **Code:** Install any required Python libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   * Update Lambda function code in the `lambda` directory with your specific logic.
   * Customize data sources and destinations in the CloudFormation template and scripts.
   * Configure any Glue jobs or additional steps if applicable.

4. **Testing**
   * Upload sample data to the input S3 bucket.
   * Monitor the pipeline execution via CloudWatch.
   * Verify the processed data in the destination bucket or database.

## Customization and Extension

* **Adding Data Sources:** Integrate with other AWS services (e.g., Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams) or external sources.
* **Data Transformations:** Implement custom transformations within Lambda functions or Glue ETL jobs.
* **Machine Learning:** Incorporate Amazon SageMaker for model training and inference.
* **Scheduling:**  Set up time-based triggers for regular pipeline runs.
